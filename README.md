# WordCompare
A Java program that can compare if your word appears in the wordlist.txt using Java HashMap. Useful also for searching if your jumbled word is in the wordlist, unjumbled.

# How to use
- Edit wordlist.txt with your own words or dictionary that you use.
- Run main.java then enter your word, if that word is in your wordlist.txt, then it should appear in the console.
- Jumbled words can also be entered and the unjumbled word will be the output.

# Disclaimer
This program doesn't unjumble the word for you, it justs search for the string with the same hashmap as the entered string. It also just outputs one word, which is the first word it matches in the wordlist.txt.
